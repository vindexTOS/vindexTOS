# Giorgi Kutateladze
Software Engineer

I build systems that run in the real world: IoT platforms, EV chargers, elevator systems, GPS tracking, kiosks, and real-time device networks.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of backend, infrastructure, and devices — things that need to stay online, scale horizontally.

I’m comfortable owning a product end-to-end: backend services, mobile apps, admin panels, deployments, and monitoring.

## System Design & Architecture
- Designed and operated **scalable, multi-instance systems** handling real-time device traffic
- Experience with **horizontal scaling**, stateless services, and **load-balanced APIs**
- Designed **event-driven architectures** using message queues (RabbitMQ) to prevent data loss and duplicates
- Implemented **idempotency, retries, and dead-letter flows** for payments and telemetry
- Comfortable with **service decomposition**, versioning, and safe rollouts
- Production experience debugging race conditions, bottlenecks, and distributed failures
- Familiar with reverse proxies and traffic routing (Nginx), health checks, and zero-downtime deployments
